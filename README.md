- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilenPG
  
- 👀 I’m interested into learning every day a little more. Love cats, dogs, animals in general, plants, music.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to implement an I.A, in the context of my peer-project in which we are developing an app where you can chat with the Hunter x Hunter anime's characters ✨

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every kind of team where i could keep developing myself as a Full Stack Developer
  
- 📫 You can reach me ...
  
- 🌈 Pronouns: Him/Them

- ⚡ Fun fact: One of my dog buddie's is called Dewey because of his resemblance to Dewey from the series "Malcolm in the middle" (mostly his ears and inner brilliance, have to say it)
