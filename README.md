- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to implement an I.A, in the context of my peer-project in which we are developing an app where you can chat with the Hunter x Hunter anime's characters ✨

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every kind of team where i could keep developing myself as a Full Stack Developer
