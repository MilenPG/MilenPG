- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilenPG
  
- 👀 I’m interested into learning every day, cats, dogs, animals in general, plants, music.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about testing technologies, focus on Node and Jest,
      in context of my peer-project in which we are developing an app where, with IA's help, you can chat with the Hunter x Hunter anime's characters

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every kind of team where i could keep developing myself as a Full Stack Developer
  
- 📫 You can reach me ...
  
- 😄 Pronouns: Them/He

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before i get into the IT world, i was a phytotherapist and pastry baker...well i'm still, but now only for pleasure
